What is GBDI Arboretum
=======================================================================

The GBDI Arboretum is a portable C++ library which implements various
metric access method (MAM). By using this library, any application will
be able to perform similarity queries (queries by contents) with the
minimum efforts possible. Furthermore, it will provide a robust and
uniform platform for MAM developers which allows fair comparisons
among all methods implemented by this library.


Version History
=======================================================================

1.0.1:
	- Mingw with GCC 3.x compile error fixed.
	- Better make scripts.
	- Small documentation updates.

1.0:
   - First public release.


Supported MAM
=======================================================================

This version contains the implementation of:

   - Sequential Scan (stDummyTree)
   - Slim-Tree (stSlimTree)
   

Supported Systems
=======================================================================

GBDI Arboretum version 1.0 is available for various systems:

Instalation
=======================================================================

Basic Requirements
------------------

All compilers must support C++ and have the Standard C++ Library installed
(a.k.a. STL).


GNU GCC - Any platform
----------------------

You may use the Makefile located in the directory "lib/gcc". The resulting
library will be located at "lib/libarboretum.a". This file must be linked
to your application in order to compile it.

	make -f Makefile.gcc

Note 1: To compile the Windows version, you must use MingW or Cygwin. GNU
Make is required.

Note 2: We tested it with GCC versions 2.95 and 3.x.

BCB 5
-----

There is a project file in the directory "lib/bcc5". The resulting library
will be located at "lib/arboretum.lib". This file must be linked to your
application in order to compile it.

BCB 6
-----

There is a project file in the directory "lib/bcc5". The resulting library
will be located at "lib/arboretum.lib". This file must be linked to your
application in order to compile it.


Compiling the Examples
=======================================================================

To compile the examples found in sample, you must compile the library
first. After that, goto the desired example directory and run the build
scripts.

Except for the sample-02_SlimTree, which was designed for Borland C++
Builder 5. The other examples can be compiled by C++ Builder and GCC
compilers.


Visualization Support
=======================================================================
      
The visualization support must be enabled during the library and
application compile time by defining the macro "__stMAMVIEW__".
See its documentation for more details about its usage.

Documentation
=======================================================================
      
In order to recreate the reference guide, you must get Doxygen
at http://www.doxygen.org/. Install it (full installation with dot and
latex is recommended), goto docs directory and type:

	doxygen

This command will generate a new directory, called html which contains
the reference guide. You can also download it from the download site at

	http://gbdi.icmc.usp.br/arboretum/


Bug Report and Issues
=======================================================================

To report bugs, suggest new issues and other things, please goto our
Bugzilla repository and posts bugs there:

	http://gbdi.icmc.usp.br/bugzilla/

We will be glad to solve the bugs posted problems as soon as possible.

We are also open to external contributions which may be posted in the
bugzilla too. They will be analised and, if accepted, full credts will
be given.
